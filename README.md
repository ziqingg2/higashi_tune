Higashi Tune is an ambient/minimalist/algorithmic piece based on melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic material of four tradtional Chinese folk genres:

1. Kuai Ban (starts from 1:01)

2. JingYun Dagu

3. JingDong Dagu
(This genre is similar to 2.JingYun Dagu with the exception that JingYun Dagu is based in Beijing, China, while JingDong Dagu is mostly performed in Tianjin, China)

* 1, 2, 3 all belong a larger category, Quyi(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quyi), while 4 is a slightly more "serious" genre comparing to the other 3)

4. Hebei Bangzi
(This genre is very similar to Peking Opera in terms of form, characters, and type of plays)

This piece is almost entirely composed of musical material of the interludes/preludes from these 4 genres. After the original melody/rhythm of them first appeared, they are divided into smaller chunks of short melodic, harmonic, or rhythmic units as Pbinds. The order of pitches and note durations are shuffled or randomly selected, and then the results are processed by applying reverb/delay. Meanwhile, there are some other material (mostly generated by granular synthesis) used as ambient sound sources. I mapped these Pbinds onto TouchOSC as push buttons or tuggles which control the playing or stoping of events.
